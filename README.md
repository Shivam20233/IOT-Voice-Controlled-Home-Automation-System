# IOT-Voice-Controlled-Home-Automation-System
With the help of Android app and Arduino Uno I have make this voice controlled Home Automation System. The Android app sends the serial data to the connected Bluetooth Module HC-05 by clicking ON button. The Bluetooth device receives the data from the app and sends it through TX pin of Bluetooth module to RX pin of Arduino. The Arduino device read the input data and process it according to program uploaded inside it and generate the output to 4 Chanel Relay Module. When the Bluetooth application's button turns ON, it sets the home light ON, and when the Bluetooth application's button turns OFF, it sets the home light OFF.
Compile and upload your code into the Arduino device using Arduino USB cable. While uploading code doesn't connect other devices with Arduino.
